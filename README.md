I created these cheatsheets to help my friends who are learning python.

I have used Python as my primary coding language for over 3 years now,
so here's my documented code on it, to help you learn.

Note: This is a cheatsheet, therefore it is targeted at people with prior programming experience,
and help them get through the basic syntax of python in the shortest time possible.
However, I have taken my time to document it right, to make it more beginner friendly.
Though it should not be your primary source, it can surely help you get a headstart.
