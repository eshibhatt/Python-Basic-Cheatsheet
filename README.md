I created these cheatsheets to help my friends who are learning python.

I have used Python as my primary coding language for over 3 years now,
so here's my documented code on it, to help you learn.

Note: 
1. This is a cheatsheet, therefore it is targeted at people with prior programming experience,
and help them get through the basic syntax of python in the shortest time possible.
However, I have taken my time to document it right, to make it more beginner friendly.
Though it should not be your primary source, it can surely help you get a headstart.

2. I have intentionally left the DSA part, as python has more in built data structures than
other mainstream languages. And putting it here will only confuse you. 
Nonetheless, I will create two more repos, to implement Data-structures and Algorithms in Python,
respectively.

Suggested flow of acquiring any programming language (in my opinion):
1. Basics
2. Flow of Control
3. Loops
4. Functions
5. Objects & Classes
6. Arrays
